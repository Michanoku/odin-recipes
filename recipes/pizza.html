  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This recipe takes the classic cheese pizza and adds a unique ingredient.
    Fiddlehead ferns. When going foraging for fresh vegetables, fiddlehead ferns are a favorite
    of many locals. Here we use them to create an interesting and fresh take on a vegetable pizza.
  </p>
  <p>
    These ferns are best enjoyed after having picked them yourself during a nice hike, but you can 
    also find them in local shops that sell foraged vegetables and mushrooms.
