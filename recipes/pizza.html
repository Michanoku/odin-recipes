    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This recipe takes the classic cheese pizza and adds a unique ingredient.
      Fiddlehead ferns. When going foraging for fresh vegetables, fiddlehead ferns are a favorite
      of many locals. Here we use them to create an interesting and fresh take on a vegetable pizza.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ferns are best enjoyed after having picked them yourself during a nice hike, but you can 
      also find them in local shops that sell foraged vegetables and mushrooms.
