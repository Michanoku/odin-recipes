Odin Recipes

This is the first project I am doing for Odin. I am probably already
more advanced than the scope of this project. I want to fill gaps and
take this course seriously, however, so I will do my best to deliver
a clean final version. After the project is finished, I will reflect here on 
things I already knew, new things I may have picked up or alternative ways
of doing things I had not considered before.

I mainly want to use this project to improve my use of git, as I had only used it
quite amateurish so far. 

Images used in this project are taken by me with food made by me or members of my family.

Reflection:

I did this project to the specifications. I could already add more CSS to it now, 
but I decided not to. I want to focus on the things I want to improve on, which is git. 
I found it rather challenging to get used to atomic commits. I think more practice
is needed in the future. I did not always manage to use the increments in commits I 
was going for. Also, since there was not much code to change, I mainly stuck to single line
commit messages. This is also something I want to learn more in the future, longer commit messages. 

I think I did learn how to use git more responsibly but I still need more practice to get better.
