Odin Recipes

This is the first project I am doing for Odin. I am probably already
more advanced than the scope of this project. I want to fill gaps and
take this course seriously, however, so I will do my best to deliver
a clean final version. After the project is finished, I will reflect here on 
things I already knew, new things I may have picked up or alternative ways
of doing things I had not considered before.

I mainly want to use this project to improve my use of git, as I had only used it
quite amateurish so far.
